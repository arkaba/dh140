Hi, my name is Adam Kaba and I'm taking DH140, Coding for Humanities.

I'm a 4th year Cognitive Science major, minoring in Statistics and Digital Humanities.

I dont have specific ideas for a project question as of now, however I'm very interested in the technology and entertainment industry so my datasets will likely come from there.
I hope to work in data science or maybe UI/UX as a career, so I'm looking forward to learning things that could potentially apply to those fields!.
