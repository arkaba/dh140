Watching Rachels video, the topic of missing maps itself was pretty interesting to me. For one, I've always wondered how places actually get mapped out. I remember
when I was younger I'd be surprised to see relatively small nooks and crannies be mentioned on mapquest. Even now I sometimes find myself searching random places on Google
Earth, and "Exploring" them so to speak. On the other hand, as a result I just thought most places were mapped for some reason, so the concept of "missing maps" was something 
that had never crossed my mind before. I think using an open data approach is super smart. Even the tiniest community has many different twists and turns that would cost an
inhuman amount of money for them to spend spend mapping it. As Rachel said, "We know our communities best." On top of that collaborative approach works much better as more ground
gets covered at once. I'm curious to see if a variant of this technology could be applied to other aspects of life, because it's cool to see how this project has been helping out
even mroe since the advent of coronavirus.
