The article talks about how data science has evolved over the years, and how it's evolution affects our lives. The amount of data being used increases everyday,
and with that our digital footprint gets bigger and bigger. An issue we discussed in class was that companies were getting a hold of our data without our knowledge.
This article, however discusses how the data is being used without our knowledge. As data science moves more and more towards AI, results tend to be "behind a wall" so to speak.
There are many cases in which algorithms used to make decisions which affect our lives become hidden. The article discusses this and also implications of aggregating spatial info.

This article spoke to me as it was an eye opener. Not necessarily new or shocking information that information was being gathered and used under our noses, however these particular
implications were ones I never thought of in the past. Growing up, and even relatively recently when learning how to code I always thought documentation of the process was a chore. 
However, only recently upon taking more coding classes did I realize how important a step that is. The article also reaffirmed something I learned fairly recently, in how 
useful/beneficial open-source software is. The software can range from programming, to something as common as anti-virus software. Many things we use and download are hidden behind
a layer, we just assume it does its job and nothing else. However it can sometimes be a mystery *how* it does it's job or if it does more than its intended purpose. Hence why open
source products are so nice, it removes that layer of ambiguity which is better for all parties involved. Going forward this is definitely something I'll want to be aware of if
I ever decide to publish software or anything.
